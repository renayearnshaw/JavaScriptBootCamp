# JavaScriptBootCamp
This project contains code I wrote while following [The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript/) course by Andrew Mead

### Description
The __JavaScriptBootCamp__ project is written using ES6 and ES7 JavaScript.
<br>The project contains various JavaScript code snippets, which can be run using Node.js.
<br><br>The project also contains three web applications:
1. A note-taking app, that allows users to add, edit, delete, and save their notes. See https://renay-earnshaw-notes.netlify.com/
2. A to-do application.  See https://renay-earnshaw-todos.netlify.com/
3. A hangman word game, which uses _Promises_ and _Async/Await_ to produce asynchronous JavaScript. See https://renay-earnshaw-hangman.netlify.com/
